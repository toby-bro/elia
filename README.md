## Introduction

`elia` is an application for interacting with LLMs which runs entirely in your terminal, and is designed to be keyboard-focused, efficient, and fun to use!
It stores your conversations in a local SQLite database, and allows you to interact with a variety of models.
Speak with proprietary models such as ChatGPT and Claude, or with local models running through `ollama` or LocalAI.

## Installation

Install Elia with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```bash
pipx install --python 3.11 elia-chat
```

Run Elia with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (without installing it):

```bash
uvx --from elia-chat -p 3.11 elia
```

To install it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), run:

```bash
uv tool install -p 3.11 elia-chat
```

Lastly, to install it with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) from local source, run:

```bash
cd elia  # wherever you cloned the repo
uv tool install --editable . -p 3.11
```

Depending on the model you wish to use, you may need to set one or more environment variables (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` etc).

## Quickstart

Launch Elia from the command line:

```bash
elia
```

Launch a new chat inline (under your prompt) with `-i`/`--inline`:

```bash
elia -i "What is the Zen of Python?"
```

Launch a new chat in full-screen mode:

```bash
elia "Tell me a cool fact about lizards!"
```

Specify a model via the command line using `-m`/`--model`:

```bash
elia -m gpt-4o
```

Options can be combined - here's how you launch a chat with Gemini 1.5 Flash in inline mode (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable).

```bash
elia -i -m gemini/gemini-1.5-flash-latest "How do I call Rust code from Python?"
```

## Running local models

1. Install [`ollama`](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).
2. Pull the model you require, e.g. `ollama pull llama3`.
3. Run the local ollama server: `ollama serve`.
4. Add the model to the config file (see below).

## Configuration

The location of the configuration file is noted at the bottom of
the options window (`ctrl+o`).

The example file below shows the available options, as well as examples of how to add new models.

```toml
# the ID or name of the model that is selected by default on launch
default_model = "gpt-4o"
# the system prompt on launch
system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant who talks like a pirate."

# choose from "nebula", "cobalt", "twilight", "hacker", "alpine", "galaxy", "nautilus", "monokai", "textual"
theme = "galaxy"

# change the syntax highlighting theme of code in messages
# choose from https://pygments.org/styles/
# defaults to "monokai"
message_code_theme = "dracula"

# example of adding local llama3 support
# only the `name` field is required here.
[[models]]
name = "ollama/llama3"

# example of a model running on a local server, e.g. LocalAI
[[models]]
name = "openai/some-model"
api_base = "http://localhost:8080/v1"
api_key = "api-key-if-required"

# example of add a groq model, showing some other fields
[[models]]
name = "groq/llama2-70b-4096"
display_name = "Llama 2 70B"  # appears in UI
provider = "Groq"  # appears in UI
temperature = 1.0  # high temp = high variation in output
max_retries = 0  # number of retries on failed request

# example of multiple instances of one model, e.g. you might
# have a 'work' OpenAI org and a 'personal' org.
[[models]]
id = "work-gpt-3.5-turbo"
name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
display_name = "GPT 3.5 Turbo (Work)"

[[models]]
id = "personal-gpt-3.5-turbo"
name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
display_name = "GPT 3.5 Turbo (Personal)"
```

## Custom themes

Add a custom theme YAML file to the themes directory.
You can find the themes directory location by pressing `ctrl+o` on the home screen and looking for the `Themes directory` line.

Here's an example of a theme YAML file:

```yaml
name: example # use this name in your config file
primary: "#4e78c4"
secondary: "#f39c12"
accent: "#e74c3c"
background: "#0e1726"
surface: "#17202a"
error: "#e74c3c" # error messages
success: "#2ecc71" # success messages
warning: "#f1c40f" # warning messages
```

## Changing keybindings

Right now, keybinds cannot be changed. Terminals are also rather limited in what keybinds they support.
For example, pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to send a message is not possible (although we may support a protocol to allow this in some terminals in the future).

For now, I recommend you map whatever key combo you want at the terminal emulator level to send `\n`.
Here's an example using iTerm:

<img width="848" alt="image" src="https://github.com/darrenburns/elia/assets/5740731/94b6e50c-429a-4d17-99c2-affaa828f35b">

With this mapping in place, pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> will send a message to the LLM, and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> alone will create a new line.

## Import from ChatGPT

Export your conversations to a JSON file using the ChatGPT UI, then import them using the `import` command.

```bash
elia import 'path/to/conversations.json'
```

## Wiping the database

```bash
elia reset
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
pipx uninstall elia-chat
```
